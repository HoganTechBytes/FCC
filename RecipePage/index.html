    <h1>Viking Flatbread</h1>
    <p>
      This Viking flatbread is so flavorful. Using flours the Vikings might have
      used—spelt flour and rye flour—and moistening the dough with buttermilk
      rather than water, the flatbreads have a bit of a sourdough note.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cup spelt flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup rye flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step one</strong>: Combine flour, spelt flour, rye flour, and
        salt in a bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step two</strong>: Pour in buttermilk, and stir until a shaggy
        dough forms. Clean off the spoon and work the mixture with your hands
        until it comes together into a ball of dough, and the sides of the bowl
        are clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step three</strong>: Transfer onto a work surface, and using
        only enough flour to prevent sticking, knead until a smooth, elastic,
        and slightly sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover dough and let it
        rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step four</strong>: Divide into 6 equal portions and roll each
        one into a ball. Using just enough flour to prevent sticking, roll each
        portion out into a circle about 1/8-inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step five</strong>: Heat a dry cast iron pan over medium-high
        heat. Place in flatbread and cook until browned and blistered, about 1
        to 1 1/2 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step six</strong>: Pile up cooked flatbreads on a plate and
        cover with a dry kitchen towel as they are being made. Let rest,
        covered, for about 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
